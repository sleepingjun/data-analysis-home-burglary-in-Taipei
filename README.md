Recently, I have been trying to tidy up my past project, and then I will write a document to record.  
I did this project 3-4 years age, and used excel to analyze; however, I lost my file. Therefore, I decide to rewrite it.  

## Introduction  
This project is to analyze the [dataset](https://data.gov.tw/dataset/130312) named 臺北市住宅竊盜點位資訊 from Taiwan government opendata platform.  

## Target - What I want to know?  
Q. Which administrative area is more peaceful/dangerous than others. (find top3)  
A. Safe: Datong(大同), Nangang(南港), Wenshan(文山); Dangerous: Zhongshan(中山), Shilin(士林), Wanhua(萬華)  
Explanation: Acoording to these figures below, I found that house burglary cases in Datong are less than other areas, and those in Zhongshan are more. I was taken aback, when I knew that Zhongshan is the most dangerous district. Since there are many delicious dessert shops:cry:.  Maybe the next step I can do further analysis on it.

Q. Whether Public Security improves every year?  
A. Yes.   
Q. Whether Public Security is influenced by month? (maybe it's too cold/hot to steal XD)  
A. No.  
Q. Whether Public Security is influenced by date?  
A. Yes. Cases in 1 and 15 are more than other days. I suppose that is due to payday, because most of Taiwanses people's payday is in the beginning or middle of month.
