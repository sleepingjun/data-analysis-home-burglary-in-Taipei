Recently, I have been trying to tidy up my past project, and then I will write a document to record.  
I did this project 3-4 years age, and used excel to analyze; however, I lost my file. Therefore, I decide to rewrite it.  

## Introduction  
This project is to analyze the [dataset](https://data.gov.tw/dataset/130312) named 臺北市住宅竊盜點位資訊 from Taiwan government opendata platform.  

##Target - What I want to know?  
- The top 3 safe admin area
- Whether Public Security improves every year?
- Whether Public Security is influenced by month? (maybe it's too cold/hot to steal XD)
